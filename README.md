# Human-Activity-Detection

It involves predicting the movement of a person based on sensor data and traditionally involves deep domain expertise and methods from signal processing to correctly engineer features from the raw data in order to fit a machine learning model.

Recently, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks have shown capable and even achieve state-of-the-art results by automatically learning features from the raw sensor data
#Problem Statement
I have used #LSTM and #CNN for this project and also #Hyper Parameter Tuning to imporve accuracy upto 95^%^
