# Human-Activity-Detection

It involves predicting the movement of a person based on sensor data and traditionally involves deep domain expertise and methods from signal processing to correctly engineer features from the raw data in order to fit a machine learning model.

Recently, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks have shown capable and even achieve state-of-the-art results by automatically learning features from the raw sensor data

# Problem Statement
I have used <b>LSTM</b> and <b>CNN</b> for this project and also <b>Hyper Parameter Tuning</b> to imporve accuracy upto 95^%^
